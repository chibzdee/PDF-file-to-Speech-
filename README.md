# PDF-file-to-Speech-

This project involves creating a Python script that converts the text from a PDF file into speech. The script uses PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract text from the PDF, and pyttsx3 to convert the text into speech, which can be played directly or saved as an MP3 file. An optional tkinter interface allows users to select PDF files easily. The script handles large PDFs by splitting the text into chunks for efficient processing. This tool enhances accessibility for visually impaired users and is useful for anyone who prefers listening to documents.
